A simple vegan spaghetti sauce.

**Total time**: 1 to 1.5 hours

## Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 1 bulb of garlic, cut crosswise
* Handful of green onions, chopped
* 10oz can of black olives (3oz drained), cut into quarters
* 20oz can of whole tomatoes, chopped
* 1tbsp Tomato paste

**Spices**

* Black pepper
* Hot red pepper flakes
* Salt

## Instructions

* Coat bottom of pan with olive oil and heat over low heat.
* Cut bulb of garlic crosswise, put both top and bottom in hot olive oil.
* Allow garlic to turn golden (~10min).
* Remove garlic (you can eat the nicely roasted garlic now).
* Add chopped green onion and hot pepper, turn heat up a bit to medium-low, and
  fry for ~5min.
* Add black olives, fry until well done (~20min, careful olives will spit oil
  when you add them.  Should be somewhat shriveled and not rubbery).
* Add in whole tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, and pepper.
* Simmer for 30min to 1hr.
* Serve over Barilla #3 spaghetti or similar.

## Notes

 * My batch on Dec 8 2020 was too acidic, might have used too many tomatoes
   (threw in an extra half jar) or too much tomato paste.  Tried to mellow it
   with some sugar.  Found this
   [suggestion](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-make-spaghetti-less-acidic):

> Taste the sauce when close to being done. If it seems too acidic, put in a
> pinch--I REALLY MEAN a PINCH of baking soda (not baking powder, we want
> sodium bicarbonate)...The next thing to do is add sugar. You have to learn to
> go between very small additions of baking soda and sugar until you reach the
> acidity you want...You must add salt and taste again. You cannot taste the
> spices and acidity without the right salt amount and you cannot taste the
> right amount of salt until the acidity is close...This is a balancing act you
> have to teach your tongue. Baking soda and sugar, then salt and finally
> spices. You may have to go back and start over with the additions in that
> order if the final product is not perfectly excellent.
