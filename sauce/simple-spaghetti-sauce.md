A simple vegan spaghetti sauce.

**Total time**: 1 to 1.5 hours

## Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 1 bulb of garlic, cut crosswise
* Handful of green onions, chopped
* 10oz can of black olives (3oz drained), cut into quarters
* 20oz can of whole tomatoes, chopped
* 1tbsp Tomato paste

**Spices**

* Black pepper
* Hot red pepper flakes
* Salt

## Instructions

* Coat bottom of pan with olive oil and heat over low heat.
* Cut bulb of garlic crosswise, put both top and bottom in hot olive oil.
* Allow garlic to turn golden (~10min).
* Remove garlic (you can eat the nicely roasted garlic now).
* Add chopped green onion and hot pepper, turn heat to medium, and fry for
  ~5min.
* Add black olives, fry until well done (~20min, careful olives will spit oil
  when you add them.  Should be somewhat shriveled and not rubbery).
* Add in whole tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, and pepper.
* Simmer for 30min to an hour.
* Serve over Barilla #3 spaghetti or similar.
