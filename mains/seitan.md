## Ingredients

**Spices**

* Garlic Powder
* Onion Powder
* Paprika
* Nutritional Yeast
* Salt
* Pepper
* Soy sauce
* Olive oil
* Veggie stock

## Instructions

* Combine water and flour into a dough ball (rough ratio 3 flour to 1 water).
* Knead until smooth (~10min).
* Rest for 1 to 12 hours.
* Knead again underwater.  Change water as it gets cloudy.  Stop when water is
  noticably less cloudy (but not clear).
* Add and knead in dry seasoning (paprika, garlic powder, onion powder,
  nutritional yeast, salt, pepper).
* Rest 1 hour.
* Twist and knot.
* Pan fry in hot oil until you get a nice sear on both sides.
* Add veggie stock and soy sauce to pain (careful, the hot oil will spit). Note
  - don't cover it in liquid, just need a shallow layer.
* Simmer covered for ~45min.  Note: don't boil it, just need a shallow coat of
  liquid.
* Let cool, rest in fridge for ~8 hours for its texture to really come together.
