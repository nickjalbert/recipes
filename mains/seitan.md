**Total time**: TODO

## Ingredients

* Flour

**Spices**

* Garlic Powder
* Onion Powder
* Paprika
* Nutritional Yeast
* Salt
* Pepper
* Soy sauce
* Olive oil
* Veggie stock

## Instructions

* Combine water and flour into a dough ball (rough ratio 3 flour to 1 water).
* Knead until smooth (~10min).
* Rest for 1 to 12 hours.
* Knead again underwater.  Change water as it gets cloudy.  Stop when water is
  noticably less cloudy (but not clear).
* Add and knead in dry seasoning (paprika, garlic powder, onion powder,
  nutritional yeast, salt, pepper).
* Rest 1 hour.
* Twist and knot.
* Pan fry in hot oil until you get a nice sear on both sides.
* Add veggie stock and soy sauce to pain (careful, the hot oil will spit). Note:
  don't cover it in liquid, just need a shallow layer.
* Simmer covered for ~45min.  Note: don't boil it, just need a shallow coat of
  liquid.
* Let cool, rest in fridge for ~8 hours for its texture to really come together.
 
## Notes

* Work in progress recipe

* 3:1 flour to water (knead until its a smooth dough ball)
* Place the dough in a bowl covered by water, rest 1 to 8 hours (2 hours most recently)
* Wash the dough; knead underwater
* Rest the dough for 1 hour
* Add in seasoning: garlic, nutritional yeast, onion, salt, pepper, paprika
* Stretch and knot the dough
* pan fry in olive oil
* simmer for 45 min in olive oil, veggie stock, and soy sauce
* Let rest in fridge for 8 hours

* Result 1: May 21, 2021 - This came out overly dense.  I suspect I could knead
  it more, wash it better, and add a bit more broth.   Still very tasty; pan
  fried slices in a store-bought garlic wing sauce and made little sandwiches
  on baguette with cheese, tomato, lettuce, and mustard.
