**Total time**: 2 hours

## Ingredients

* Pan (23cm x 23cm x 4cm in this case)
* Aluminum foil
* Lasagne noodles (oven ready)
* ~300g shredded mozzarella
* ~50g shredded parmesan
* Red pepper flakes
* Salt
* Black Peppers

**Sauce**

* Olive oil
* 1 med to large yellow onion (chopped)
* 3 cloves minced garlic
* 2 cups chopped mushrooms
* 1 tsp dried rosemary
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* (optional) sweet red wine
* 1 big jar of tomatoes (~28oz)
* 1 bay leaf

**Filling**

* 250g cottage cheese (or ricotta and hold the oil and cream)
* 2 bunches raw chopped spinach
* 2 eggs 
* 2 tbsp heavy cream
* 2 tbsp olive oil

## Instructions

**Sauce**

* Heat olive oil in a medium-large pot over medium high.
* Add chopped onions and saute 1 to 2 minutes until translucent and starting to
  soften.
* Add garlic and stir 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant.
* Add mushrooms and saute about 5 minutes. 
* Add rosemary, thyme, oregano, and tomato paste; stir to combine.
* Deglaze the bottom of the pot with balsamic vinegar.
* Add tomatoes and juice from jar, a bit of water, bay leaf, salt, and pepper.
* Lower heat to low and simmer 20 to 30 minutes. 
* You can balance acidity with a bit of sweet red wine.

**Filling**

* Wash and chop spinach, squeeze water out with hand.
* Add eggs, olive oil, heavy cream, and cottage cheese
* Blend with a blender stick until the filling is homogeneous.

**Lasagne**

* Grease your pan.
* Layer as follows: filling, sauce, shredded mozzarella, noodles (mine had two
  layers of noodles, with a final layer of filling, sauce, and mozzarella)
* Top with leftover mozzarella, parmesan, and red pepper flakes.
* Cover with foil.
* Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes at 190C.
* Uncover and bake for 10 more minutes to crisp up.
* Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes.

## Notes

* A bit of dried basil also goes nicely in the sauce.  Keep a bit of sour bite
  in the sauce; it will be offset with the noodles and filling.
* Mushrooms and spinach might have been a bit much, might do one or the other
  next time.
* Ingredient amounts seem real flexible.
* You can assemble the lasagna and then freeze it for cooking later.
