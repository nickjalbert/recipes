## Ingredients

* 430g All Purpose Flour
* 345g water
* 8g salt
* 1g yeast

## Procedure

### Day 1

* **Autolyse:**  Warm water in microwave.  Mix with flour.  Let sit for 30min.

* **Incorporate Yeast and Salt:** Mix yeast and salt into the flour/water
  mixture.  Incorporate well by folding and pincering.  Wet your mixing hand
  liberally.

* **Rise:** Set aside dough for 18-24hr.

* **Fold:** Optional.  1-2hr after the rise has started, gently fold dough 1-3
  times.

### Day 2

* **Shape:** After 18-24hr of rising, gently ease dough out of its container
  onto floured surface.  Gently fold the dough and invert.  Tighten the dough.
  Well-floured hands help a lot.

* **Proof:** Place dough into parchment lined dutch oven seam side up.  Flour
  the bread, cover, and allow it to proof for 1.5-3hr

* **Bake:** Place covered dutch oven into oven.  Set oven to "convection bake"
  at 425 degrees.  Allow to bake for 1hr with cover on

* **Crisp:** Remove cover from dutch oven.  Allow the bake to finish for
  15-20min until bread is an appetizing color.

* **Cool:** Remove bread from dutch oven and place on wire rack.  Allow
  30min-1hr before cutting.

## Notes

* On Day 2, it takes about 4hr to go from the "Shape" step to ready-to-eat
  bread
