# No-Soak Black Beans

## Description

Quick way to turn dried black beans into something tasty.

**Total time**: ~2.5 hours

## Ingredients

* 450g Dried black beans
* 45g olive oil
* 4 smashed garlic cloves
* 1 med onion

### Spices

* 1 tsp of cumin
* 1.5 Bay leaf
* Hot pepper
* Salt
* Pepper

### Garnish with

* Cilantro

## Instructions

* **Quick soak:** 
    * Place beans in a large, heavy pot.
    * Add water until beans are covered by about 2 inches.
    * Cover pot, bring to a boil, then remove from heat.
    * Let rest 1 hour. 
* Stir in 1 tsp. kosher salt (careful here, can always add more later) and
  bring to a boil over medium heat.
* Uncover, reduce heat, and simmer until beans are tender and creamy, checking
  after 1 hour and adding more water as necessary to keep beans submerged, 1–1
  1/2 hours total.
* **Seasoning:**
    * Heat 3 tbsp olive oil in a large pan
    * Sautee garlic and red pepper until garlic starts to brown
    * Add onion saute for ~5min
    * Add beans to pan, cook ~20min
    * Add bay leaf, cumin (not too crazy on the cumin), black pepper and cook
      until thick (another ~20min)
    * Finish with a dash of balsamic vinegar (not too much though!)

## Notes

* Adding some butter might be a nice touch.
* I have in the past: over-salted, over-cumin'd, and over-vinegar'd.  A light
  touch is rewarded!
