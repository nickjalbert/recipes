Quick way to turn dried black beans into something tasty.

**Total time**: ~2.5 hours

## Ingredients

* 450g Dried black beans
* 45g olive oil
* 4 smashed garlic cloves
* 1 med onion

**Spices**

* 1 tsp of cumin
* 1.5 Bay leaf
* Hot pepper flakes
* Salt
* Pepper
* (optional) Veggie stock powder

**Garnish with**

* Cilantro

## Instructions

* **Quick soak:**
    * Place beans in a large, heavy pot.
    * Add water until beans are covered by about 2 inches.
    * Cover pot, bring to a boil, then remove from heat.
    * Let rest 1 hour.
* Stir in 1 tsp. kosher salt (careful here, can always add more later).
* Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat.
* Reduce heat and simmer until beans are tender and creamy, checking after
  45min and adding more water as necessary to keep beans submerged.
* **Seasoning:**
    * Heat 3 tbsp olive oil in a large pan.
    * Sautee garlic and red pepper until garlic starts to brown.
    * Add onion and saute for ~5min.
    * Add beans to pan, then add bay leaf, cumin (not too crazy on the cumin),
      black pepper, and veggie stock (optional) and cook until thick (another
      ~20min).
    * Finish with a dash of balsamic vinegar (not too much though!).

## Notes

* Adding some butter might be a nice touch.
* I have in the past: over-salted, over-cumin'd, over-veggie-stock'd, and
  over-vinegar'd.  A light touch is rewarded!
* I have added a bit (maybe 1 or 2 tsp, max 1 tbsp) of veggie stock powder and
  it turned out well.  Watch the salt in this case, though.

## Changes

* Combine onions, beans, spices all at once (previously: two separate steps).
* Simmer while covered.
